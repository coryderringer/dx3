# Dissertation Experiment 3
An experiment about how people form illusory correlations when one variable has positive or negative valence. The point here is to manipulate the magnitude of positive or negative outcomes. For some participants, a positive/negative outcome yielded a +/-6 cent bonus, and for others it was +/-18 cents.
