# Valence App (Experiment 2)
This is an experiment about how people learn about cause/effect relationships in which the effect has positive or negative valence. The point here is to manipulate whether "positive" means adding bonus money or not-subtracting bonus money (same for "negative" in reverse: removing money or simply not adding money).
